Lab 2 Writeup

There is tone in Tibetan, so we have included the following as markers for high and low tones: ' and `. Also, we adopted _ as a means of joining together particles and long phrases from grammatical examples which we couldn't parse yet such as "about fiteeen people,", but that has been removed for the most part.

I & II. Test suite instances and choices

A. Word Order

(Lhasa) Tibetan is an ergative-absolutive SOV language. For intranstivie verbs, the subject is absolutive. For transitive verbs, the agent/subject of transitive verbs is ergative and the object is absolutive. We have illustrated all of the basic word orders. Here is one positive, SOV,  and one negative SVO:

Example #1
Source: a:132
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c,
ngas    stag    bsadpayin
nga-s   stag    bsad-pa-yin
I-SBJ   tiger   killed-LK-AUX
'I killed the tiger.'

Example #2
#SVO
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: wo, c,
ngas    bsadpayin       stag
nga-s   bsad-pa-yin     stag
I-SBJ   killed-LK-AUX   tiger
'I killed the tiger.'

According to source B, auxiliary verbs are particles. They follow the verb.

Source: b:178
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: pn, wo
nga 'grodgosred
nga 'gro-dgos-red
I   go-LK-AUX
'I  must go.'

Multiple auxiliary verbs can follow the verb, so it may be best to analyze them as discrete words:

Source: b:166
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: tam, wo
khonggis        slobsbyong      gnangmusyingired
khong-gis       slobsbyong      gnang-mus-yin-gi-red
She-ERG         study           do-LK-AUX-LK-AUX
"She's probably at her studies"


There are some verb-forms that are currently analyzed as transitive verbs with underspecified, and hence, absolutive subjects and objects. In this sentence, go has been nominalized and is the complement of the do verb. Because it is nounified, we implemented it as a transitive verb:

Source: b:178
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: pn
khong 'grodgos    byedkyired
khong 'gro-dgos   byed-kyi-red
she    go-nom     do-LK-AUX
'she will have to go.'


Choices: To implement this, we selected the SOV word order and ergative-absolutive paradigm under case. These two vhoices together along with the lexicon and morphology are what distinguish these sentences as grammatical and ungrammatical. We definied "transitive-verb-lex" which accepts an ergative subject and absolutive object and "perfective-intransitive-verb" which accepts absolutive agents. We have specialized types for verbs which accept dative arguments, perfective-transitive-dative-verb-lex , and two underspecified arguments, future-transitive-lex. For auxiliary verbs, we have specified that they should follow the verb, but we haven't been able to include them yet.

B. Case

(Lhasa) Tibetan has a range of 4-6 cases depending on the analysis because some wordforms cover multiple domains; due to their similarity DeLancey (Source C) refers to them as post-clitics

a. Ergative-instrumental: gis,gyis,kyis, -s after a vowel
b. Absolutitive: " "
c. Dative-Locative: la
d. Ablative:  nas/na
e. Genitive: gi/gyi/kyi

Unmarked items fall into the absolutitive case and ergative cases can be marked with -s as in "Example #1". Here are two examples showing that most transitive verbs take the absolutitive as their object; for the previously mentioned "perfective-transitive-dative-verb-lex" such as hit and ditransitive verbs take the dative as their argument

Example #3
Source: c:274
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c
thubbstangyis   blobzangla      gzhus_song
thubbstan-gyis  blobzang-la     gzhus_song
Thubten-ERG     Lobsang-DAT     hit_PRF
'Thubten hit Lobsang'

This is thus incorrect:

Example #4
Source: c:274
Vetted: s
Judgment: u
Phenomena: wo, c
thubbstangyis  blobzangla     bsadpared
thubbstan-gyis  blobzang-la   bsad-pared
Thubten-ERG     Lobsang-DAT   kill-PRF
'Thubten killed Lobsang'


Although the ergative and instrumental cases fall into the same bucket under DeLancey's analysis; the instrumental case can appear alongside an item in the ergative case:

Example #5
Source: b:203
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c
khos            yige            smyuggus       brissong
kho-s           yige            smyug-gus       bris-song
3sg-ERG         letter          pen-INST        wrote-aux
‘He wrote the letter with a pen.’


Choices: For our first grammar, we had to decide whether to make case part of all the different lexicon entries which would become cumbersome, make them clitics and/or morphological rules. We underspecified the case on most nouns and added them with the following rules which act on nouns:
bare-abs-rule turns nouns into absolutitive ones without adding a string because the case is the unmarked default
dative-lex-rule adds the dative/locative particle "la" to a noun
ergative-lex-rule adds either s or gyis to the noun to turn it into the ergative
instrumental-lex-rule adds gus to make the word instrumental
Attempts were made to implement the various forms as clitics, but at this point it was decided to use morphological rules because the nouns in our examples have been simple--this may change. Also it appears we can only have one case per adposition in the customization system. Perhaps morphological rules could operate on adpositions though.

C. Pronouns

There are pronouns for I, you and he/she in Tibetan. They do not have to agree with the verb in terms of number or gender, so it is nearly impossible to come up with ungrammatical examples at this point. With morphological rules, we could add improper inflections. We have illustrations of "I", "you", "he", and "she" as follows: 

Source: b:178
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: pn, wo
nga 'grodgosred
nga 'gro-dgos-red
I   go-LK-AUX
'I  must go.'


There's also an optional affix '-rang', which means "self" for pronouns. such as:

nga               ngarang
1st-SG            1st-SG  

The plural forms of the pronouns add '-tsho' to the singular forms, such as:

nga               ngatsho
1ST-SG            1ST-PL

khorang               khorangtsho
3RD-masculine-SG  3RD-masculine-PL

It should be noted that for the 3rd person feminine plurals the '-rang' morpheme is not optional: 'morangtsho'. Also, Tibetan has distinct honorific/ordinary forms for pronouns. And though we decided not to take honorific forms into account, the honorific form of 3rd person pronouns "khong", which means "he" or "she", appears very frequently in the examples we find.

Choices: 
To implement pronouns we just had to add them to our lexicon. At first we did not put any information about number or gender because there is no agreement, but after some feedback we did so. We also found the plural pronoun examples.

D. Rest of NP

In source b, "determinants" are often refered to as noun particles. "cig" is one of the forms which contributes to the specificity of the noun it is joined with. They are not obligatory as illustrated in the following two examples:

Source: d:100
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c,
`mibculngatsam cig yogred
`mi-bculnga-tsam cig yogred
people-fiteen-about num exist
'There are about fiteeen people.'

Source: d:100
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c,
`mibculngatsam  yogred
`mi-bculnga-tsam  yogred
people-fiteen-about exist
'There are about fiteeen people.'

We have one synthetic ungrammatical example based on the description of noun particles appearing to the right of the noun.

#assumed ungrammatical 
#with the information about particle order
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: wo, c,
cig `mibculngatsam yogred
cig `mi-bculnga-tsam yogred
num people-fiteen-about exist
'There are about fiteeen people.'

Choices: 

The simplest option was to include determiners as descrete words. Depending on challenges, the determinants may become more morphological.

E. Tense/Aspect

Tense is realized in the stem of the verbs. According to source b, there are 3 tenses in Tibetan:
a. present
b. past
c. future

We have one example of each tense such as this one. Unfortunately our examples include linking and auxiliary verbs which make them hard to parse. For some of them we have specified the verbs as one word.

Example #8
#present tense
Source: b:137
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: tam
ngas  yige    cig briskyiyod
nga-s  yige    cig bris-kyi-yod
1ST-ERG letter  num write-LK-AUX
'I am writing a letter.'

For aspect, there are:
a. several perfect markers with some slight differences in meaning

Source: a:132
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c,
nga     'sibyung
nga     'si-byung
I       die-PRF
'I have died.'

b. recent aspect: reference time immediately follows event time 

Source: a:161
Vetted: t
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c
nga     blebs-gro-yin
I       arrive-LK-AUX
'I had just arrived'

c. (Prospective) gerunditive aspect: intended or desireable with respect to reference time but not completed

Source: a:162
Vetted: t
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c
nga     nyocha          nyo-rygu-in
I       shopping        buy-LK-AUX
'I have still to do the shopping'

Others include:
d. imminent aspect
e. preparative aspect
f. premeditated aspect


Choices: we have not yet made choices with respect to these yet.

F. Wh-questions

For questions, there are interrogative noun such as "su." They undergo inflection which seems to obviate the need for them to appear in situ; example #13 shows the subject in OSV order. However, it appears that Wh nouns appear in the middle of the sentence, but it is not clear from the documentation that this obligatory.

Example #12
Source: b:130
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: c,
khongla rogspa    su  yogredpa
khongla rogspa    su  yogredpa
3SG-LOC many-NOM  who exist-wh.interr
'Who was with him?'

Example #13
Source: b:198
Vetted: s
Judgement:g
chalag  digyad sus tshong_pa_red_pa
chalag  di-gyad         sus     tshong_pa_red_pa
thing   this-num        who-ERG sell_link_aux_interr
'Who sold the things?'


Choices: 
We have not yet included negative examples or made choices with respsect to these yet.

III. Testsuite instances not yet covered

We do not parse any of the testsuite instances dealing with:
* Wh-Questions
* Aspect & Tense
* Auxiliary verbs  
* Adjunct phrases (instrumental verbs)
* Ditransitive verbs

IV. Coverage and Overgeneration

As of 23:00 on 2018-01-19, the numbers for our 49 items are as follows:

A. Coverage: 20 / 34 positive instances (62%) with 1 distinct analysis each
B. Overgeneration: 0 / 15 (0%)

For some strange reason, the errors message shows 15 items which is 1 more than what coverage indicates.

For the 14 items in positive examples, we are missing tokens in our lexicon. 

3 examples don't parse because we can't support instrumental and ditransitive arguments yet.

Many of our tam examples don't parse because they include auxiliary verbs which illustrate the tenses such as this:

#FUTURE TENSE
Source: b:137
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, c, tam
sangnyin  ngas    laska  'di   byedkyiyin
sangnyin  nga-s    laska  'di   byed-kyi-yin
tomorrow  1ST-ERG  work   this  do-LK-AUX
'He is sure to do the work.'

The second major group are questions which include question words

Source: b:130
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: c,
kyedrang   su    yin-pa
kyedrang   su    yin-pa
2ND         who   be-wh.interr
'Who are you?'

There were no incorrectly parsed sentences.

V. Outside domain of customization

One area where the customization system had challenges was creating multiple adopositions as clitics marking case. When we added two adpositions marking the same case, the system failed to parse either. Since we have simple exampels of nouns so far, we have used morphological rules.

Another issue we have had is that auxiliary verbs do not seem to be created with orthographic strings even when the stem is specified. 

Another issue is that it seems we cannot yet describe ditransitive verbs because there are only slots for subj and object. This is out of the scope of the class I gather.
