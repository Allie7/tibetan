I & II. Test suite instances and choices for starter grammar

A. Possessives

Possession in Tibetan is indicated by the genitive case on the possessor which precedes the possessum:

Unfortunately, the only full examples we found with pronominal possession also involved subject dropping and evidentiality through the AUX verb which we aren't covering:

Source: b:160
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: poss, pro-d
ngali   nyigdugs        lus		1dug
nga-li  nyigdugs        lus		1dug
I-GEN   umbrella.ABS	leave.PST	AUX
"I've left my umbrella behind (I remember doing so)"

We made an example with the subject added. We then made a coresponding ungrammatical example with incorrect order of possessor and possessum:

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: poss
ngas    nyigdugs        ngali   lus		1dug
nga-s   nyigdugs	nga-li  lus		1dug
I-ERG   umbrella.ABS	I-GEN   leave.PST	AUX
"I've left my umbrella behind (I remember doing so)"

Reading and searching through the text, we have not found evidence of inalienable possession being any different from alienable possession. Furthermore, we found a fragment for "my hand"; in the languages I know, body parts are usually the most common to be inalienable possessions. This is some evidence against it.

Source: b:102
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: poss
nga1i   lagpa
nga-1i  lagpa
I-GEN   hand.ABS
"My hand"

We found possessive noun phrases fragments which we made into a full sentence:

Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: poss
khonggi         11awa1i         pheb1gro        nakpo           re
khong-gi        11awa-1i        pheb1gro        nak-po          re
He-GEN          child-GEN       car.ABS         black-NMZ       be
"His child's car is black"

Choices: To implement these in the grammar, we created a new position class, possessive-rule-lex, which applies after case which adds either possessive,poss-gen-lex , or non-possessive, nonposs-lex, to the word with our possession strategy without appending an affix. The possession strategy is that the possessor appears first, it operates as a modifier, and the morpheme appears on the possessor as an affix which does not agree with the noun in terms of PNG. The reason we have decided on the modification strategy is that possessums can still appear with determiners.

B. Matrix yes-no questions

Yes-no questions involve putting the INTERR mood marker on the end of the last verb in the sentence as all mood markers do in Tibetan.

The simplest yes-no questions involved copulas. One which we have needed an NP complement which can't be done through the questionaire. Here is a working example with an AP-accepting copula which also includes negation:

Source: c:128
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: q
deb		mangpo          miyongngas
deb		mang-po         mi-yong-ngas
book.ABS	many-NMZ        NEG-be-INTERR
"I wonder if there are many books. (Note polarity in English)"

For yes-no questions involving other types of verbs, we have this example; this demonstrates that the question morpheme "pas" is assimilated to velar sounds it is near:

#ngas should be pas but is assimilated
Source: c:285
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: q
khyedrang       bodla           phebs   myongngas
khyedrang       bod-la          phebs   myong-ngas
you.ABS         Tibet-DAT       go.HON  experiential.AUX-Q
"Have you ever been to Tibet?"

We have a corresponding ungrammatical example with the morpheme on the wrong verb, but it parses--we will return to this:

#Made up example with Q marker on wrong verb
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: q
khyedrang       bodla           phebspas        myongngas
khyedrang       bod-la          phebs-pas       myong-ngas
you.ABS         Tibet-DAT       go.HON-Q        experiential-Q
"Have you ever been to Tibet"

Choices: To implement yes-no questions, we had to add question + to verbs marked in the INTERR mood. We implemented a series of variants of pas which go with their respective verb based on the assimilation patterns; each of the major auxliary verbs prevents affixation by all of them except one. They are instances of the mood marker position class--in particular subtypes of the interr-marker-rule. 

C. Declarative clausal complements, yes-no questions as clausal complements and nominalization

In Tibetan, declarative clausal complements appear as full clauses with nominalized verbs at the end. They are accepted as complements for the verbs which follow. There is some evidence that certain types of verbs accept certain nominalizations in some analyses, but we decided to just present two nominalizations as the same -pa and -yag.  

For embedded complement clauses, we were only able to find examples of declarative embedded clauses:

# Source C 284
# "Most complement clauses are nominalizations. The nominalizers most commonly used
# as complementizers are pa, yag rgyu and gag. The complement of a verb of perception
# or cognition can be a finite clause nominalized with -pa"
#
Source: c:284
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: emb-d
ngas    kho     laska		byed	kyi     yodpa           mthong  byung
nga-s   kho     laska		byed	kyi     yod-pa          mthong  byung
I-ERG   he.ABS  work.ABS 	do.PST	AUX	exist-NMZ       see     PRF
"I see he is working"

We have a corresponding ungrammatical example without the nominalization--which unfortunately still fires the nominalization rule which makes it parse:

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: emb-d
ngas    kho     laska		byed    kyi     yod            mthong  byung
nga-s   kho     laska		byed    kyi     yod            mthong  byung
I-ERG   he.ABS  work.ABS 	do.PST	AUX	exist	       see     PRF
"I see he is working"

Here is another example with a different nominalization particle, yag:

Source: c:284
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: emb-d
khos    laska           byedyag         1gobtsugs       song
kho-s   laska           byed-yag        1gobtsugs       song
He-ERG  work.ABS        do.NMZ          start           PRF
"He started to work"

This is a corresponding ungrammatical example which has two nominalizations applied to the same verb:

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: emb-d
khos    laska           byedyagpa               1gobtsugs       song
kho-s   laska           byed-yag-pa  	        1gobtsugs       song
He-ERG  work.ABS        do.NMZ-NMZ              start           PRF
"He started to work"

For embedded interrogative clausal complements, we were not able to find any examples. One reason is that according to source d, indirect and direct speech are represented in the same way in morphology and are distinguished by more syntatic features :

"Reported speech is indicated by the marker /s/ which corresponds to closing quotation marks. This marker /s/, derived from the verb /ser/ to say, is used for both direct and indirect speech [...] The distinguishing feature of reported speech in Tibetan is that it is inserted between the author of the quotation and the verb of speech[...] If it happens that the source of a quotation is the same person as someone who is mentioned in it, or else is the actual speaker, Tibetans prefer to substitute 'hybrid' reported speech for direct speech " (Source D 214-215)

Source C states that the 's' marker is optional and  does not even refer to the sentences as indirect or direct speech but rather "finite" verbal complements: "Finite complements occur with verbs of speech. These may be unmarked or marked with the complementizer ze, usually pronounced as the semi-syllabic [s]" (284). 

Another lead for possible embedded interrogative clausal complements was the dubatative mood marker because it corresponds with 'whether', but by following all of its uses in Source B, we found no sentences which contained complements; we added an example to tense, aspect and mood:

Source: b:128
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: tam
gsar1gyur       11eyod
gsar1gyur       11e-yod
news.ABS        DUB-exist
"I wonder whether there's any news"

A final lead was looking for question words in sentences. This yielded the alternative marker on verbs, "nam" which can appear at the end of a clause or at the end of the sentence. This makes it an impossible marker for complementation:

Source: c:131
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: ???
khong   su      yinnam  ngas    hago    mabyung 
khong   su      yin-nam nga-s   hago    ma-byung
she.ABS who     be-ALT  I-ERG   know    NEG-PRF
"I don't know who she might be."

Source: c:226
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: ???
khyedrang      ngangla         maphyinpa       gare    yinnam
khyedrang      ngang-la        ma-phyin-pa     gare    yin-nam
you.ABS        home-DAT        NEG-went-NMZ    why     be-ALT
"Why didn't you go home?"

As we couldn't classify the phenomenon, we did not include these examples in our official testsuite. We commented them out in our emb-d section. Rather than complementation, the second example is likely some sort of serial verb construction: "Who is she? I don't know"

Choices: To implement embedded declarative complement clauses, we specified that they appear in the same position as regular noun complements and that we had nominalization. We further specified that nominalization happens at the S level because there can be distinct subjects and that nominalization is syntactic only. We then created a morphological rule "nominalization" with the various forms we found in our sources, including "-pa". They add the nominalization value to the verbs. Finally, to reduce the amount of parsing ambiguity we created a special group of transitive verbs "comp-accept-verb-lex," see and know, which accept nominalized verbs as their objects to prevent overgeneration.  

D. Clausal Modifiers

Clausal modifiers appear as words which follow the subordinated clause. One with many examples is "byas" which implies a series of events.

Source: b:173
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: cl-mod
kho     laska		byas	byas    nangla          bsdad		pared
kho	laska		byas	byas    nang-la         bsdad		pa-red
3sg.ABS work.ABS	do.PST	SUB     home-DAT        stay.PST	LK-AUX
"He worked and then stayed home" 

Without the second byas, the sentence becomes a serial verb construction / coordination:

Source: b:173
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: svc, crd
kho     laska           byas    nangla          bsdad		pared
kho	laska		byas    nang-la         bsdad		pa-red
3sg.ABS work.ABS	do.PST  home-DAT        stay.PST	LK-AUX
"He worked and stayed home"

We created one ungrammatical example with the subordinator in the wrong place, before the subordinate clause, but it still seems to parse due to a head-opt rule:

#byas is not in the right place for the clause
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: cl-mod
byas    kho     laska   byas    nangla          bsdad   pared
byas    kho     laska   byas    nang-la         bsdad   pa-red
byas    3sg     work    did     home-DAT        stay    LK-AUX
"He worked and then stayed home"

The subordinated clauses can be full S's as well because they can have different subjects:

Source: b:173
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: cl-mod
kho     khalag  bzas    byas    ngas    khor    khapar          btang   	payin
kho     khalag  bzas    byas    nga-s   kho-r   khapar          btang		pa-yin
3sg     meal    ate     SUB     nga-ERG 3sg-DAT telephone       send.PST	LK-AUX
"When he had eaten, I telephoned him"

Some of the requirements for these clausal modifiers are more involved; for "before," the verb of the subordinated clause must be negated. We currently license this sentence, but we need more control to prevent ungrammatical examples.

Source: b:283
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: cl-mod
kho     rgyagarla       ma1gro  khongla         dngul   mangpo  bsags		pared
kho     rgyagar-la      ma-1gro khongla         dngul   mangpo  bsags		pa-red
he      India-DAT       NEG-go  before          money   much    save.PST	LK-AUX
"Before he went to India, he saved a lot of money"

Choices: To implement this,  we answered a few questions in the clausal modifiers section. We specified that the clausal modifier comes before the matrix clauses. Because the two clauses can either share a subject or have distinct ones, we specified that the the clausal modifier can modify either a VP or S in two different strategies. For VP subordination, we specified that the subjects were shared while S's were subordinated by a version which does not share subjects. Both of these strategies have the suborinator "byas" and the VP subordination also has "khongla" (before).

E. Argument Optionality

In examples from this week and previous weeks we have seen that there is argument optionality with regards to both subjects and object. The sources we have encountered so far do not make special mention of subject and object dropping, but there are several examples.

Here is an example of subject dropping:

Source: b:160
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: poss, pro-d
ngali   nyigdugs        lus     1dug
nga-li  nyigdugs        lus     1dug
I-GEN   umbrella.ABS    leave   AUX
"I've left my umbrella behind (I remember doing so)"
 
Here is an example of a dropped object:

Source: b:146
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo, neg, tam, pro-d
khonggis   magnang  pared
khong-gis  ma-gnang pa-red
3SG-ERG    NEG-give LK-AUX
"He didn't give it."

We have yet to see an ungrammatical example of subject or object dropping. 

Choices: The first choices for this implementation was to designate that subject and object dropping happen with any verb and that there were not subject or object markers on the verb. We also specified that subject dropping happens in all contexts. This led to some overgeneration, so we specified that subject dropping happens only happens with certain words. Unfortunately, it appears that this underspecifies behavior though because we can parse sentences with S/O-dropping without any further specification on the verbs. We did specify that the verb "byas" do.PST must have a subject and an object because it overgenerates; it  appears as a subordinating word which also could be parsed as a verb without S/O in a serial verb construction / coordianted VPs. Argument optionality seems to have interefered with all of the new libraries this week, especially possession and clausal modifiers. 

III. Testsuite instances not yet covered

We do not parse any of the testsuite instances dealing with:
* Wh-Questions
* Adjunct phrases instrumental verbs
* Ditransitives
* Adverbs and intensifiers 
* Authentic but complicated examples of crd, cl-mod

IV. Coverage and Overgeneration

As of 21:00 on 2018-02-2, the numbers are as follows:

Change:
Coverage: 25/59 -> 42/75; distinct analyses 3.62
Overgeneration: 0/24 -> 3/30 distinct analyses 3.33

28 of the unparsed examples, positive and negative, don't parse because of vocabulary and/or morphological rules. Part of the issue is that
there are still many word types like adverbs, intensifiers, and constructions such as topicality which we do not cover which come the authoritative text. 

We manage to reject 27 of the negative example parses. Most of the incorrect parses cropped up due to complex interactions between coordination, argument optionality, and the possession library and perhaps the complement library.

One of the 3 parsed negative examples is due to our lack of restrictions on the input to AUX verbs--this is due to possible multiple consecutive AUX verbs; new restrictions need to be put into place to mark verbs with mood as finite in order to prevent examples such as this from parsing:

#Made up example with Q marker on wrong verb
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: q
khyedrang       bodla           phebspas        myongngas
khyedrang       bod-la          phebs-pas       myong-ngas
you             Tibet-DAT       go.HON-Q        experiential-Q
"Have you ever been to Tibet"

This highlights the need for a considerable overhaul of the verb morphology.

Here is an example of the new cl-mod rule taking an optional argument which results in another negative example parsing through the basic-head-opt-comp rule; this is also an example of incorrect word order with the complement marker appearing before both clauses:

#byas is not in the right place for the clause
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: cl-mod
byas    kho     laska      byas    nangla          bsdad   pared
byas    kho     laska	   byas    nang-la         bsdad   pa-red
byas    3sg.ABS work.ABS   did     home-DAT        stay    LK-AUX
"He worked and then stayed home"

The third parsed negative example is due to an issue with the embedded clauses library; in all 5 parses of this sentence, nominalizations appear even though there is no nominalization particle on any of the verbs:

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: emb-d
ngas    kho     laska           byed    kyi     yod             mthong  byung
nga-s   kho     laska           byed    kyi     yod             mthong  byung
I-ERG   he.ABS  work.ABS        do      AUX     exist           see     PRF
"I see he is working"

Many of the overgenerated examples are due to interractions such as these between argument optionality, cl-mod, possession and asydentonic coordinated vps.

V. Outside domain of customization

As mention previously, there appears to be no way to specify attributes of the subordinated clause such as how the argument of "before" must be negated. This is OK for parsing, but will lead to problems in generation. One work-around could be to make a negated FORM value and specify that as a requirement.


While we can make copular verbs which take AP's, we cannot seem to make them take NP's. I imagine that this is due to some practical reason. Xinyi tried to implement sentences like "He is a student" with transitive verbs while I tried to encourage her to wait for true copular verbs. Here is an example of one we cannot parse with copular verbs:

Source: c:285
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: q, cop
kho     bodpa           redpas
kho     bodpa           red-pas
He      Tibetan         be-Q
"Is he a Tibetan?"

Another issue with copular verbs is that it appears that they can't go through the same morphological rules as other verbs, so they have to be written out in long form for any inflection.
